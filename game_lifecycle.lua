	PlayDate SDK Types Meta-File
	A collection of type annotations for the PlayDate SDK
	Compatible with SDK 1.12.3

	This file should NOT actually be imported; VSCode should automatically reference it for type completion.
	Importing this file will likely break things, as some functions are redefined for the sake of providing type definition.
