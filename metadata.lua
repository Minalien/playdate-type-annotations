	PlayDate SDK Types Meta-File
	A collection of type annotations for the PlayDate SDK
	Compatible with SDK 1.12.3

	This file should NOT actually be imported; VSCode should automatically reference it for type completion.
	Importing this file will likely break things, as some functions are redefined for the sake of providing type definition.

	Originally written by Minalien (https://cohost.org/Minalien).
	Consider this file public domain.

	The playdate.metadata table contains the values in the current gameâ€™s pdxinfo file, keyed by variable name. To retrieve the version number of the game, for example, you would use playdate.metadata.version.

	Changing values in this table at run time has no effect.
